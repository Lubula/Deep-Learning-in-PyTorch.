# CNN from Scratch to Deployment â€“ MNIST & Beyond ðŸ§ ðŸ“·

This repository is a hands-on deep dive into **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, starting from scratch and progressing to production-ready applications. Using the **MNIST dataset** and custom datasets, I explore the building blocks of CNNs, optimization techniques, and real-world deployment.
